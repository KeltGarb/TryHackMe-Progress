Tcpdump the basics

Tcpdump and libpcap library
- windows --> winpcap

BASIC PACKET CAPTURE
- i INTERFACE, i -any, i -eth0 for listening to a network face / types of
ip address show --> available network interfaces listed

tcpdump -i INTERFACE --> packets captured from specific interface
tcpdump -w FILE --> writes captured packets TO a file
tcpdump - r FILE --> read captured packets FROM a file
tcpdump -c COUNT --> counts specific # of packets 
tcpdump -n --> dont resolve ip addresses
tcpdump -nn --> dont resolve IP addresses and protocol #s
tcpdump -v --> verbose (can do -vv and -vvv)

-i wlo1 --> wifi interface

FILTERING EXPRESSIONS
logical operators: and, or, not

tcpdump host IP or HOSTNAME
tcpdump  src...
tcpdump dst...
tcpdump port #
tcpdump src port...
tcpdump dst port...
tcpdump PROTOCOL (ip, ip6, icmp, arp...)

TASK:
1. found how many packets were in a pcap file w/ the ICPM protocol --> sudo tcpdump -r traffic.pcap icmp -n | wc
2. found ip address of host from a mac address --> sudo tcpdump -r traffic.pcap arp and host 192.168.124.137
3. found hostname in first dns query --> sudo tcpdump -r traffic.pcap port 53

ADVANCED FILTERING
greater LENGTH
less LENGTH
man pcap-filter --> manual page

binary operations & (and), | (or), ! (not)

header bytes: proto[expr:size]
- proto = protocol
- expr = byte size, 0 refers to first byte
- size = # of bytes that interest us (1, 2, or 4; 1 is default)

tcp-syn
tcp-ack
tcp-fin
tcp-rst
tcp-push

tcp[tcpflags]
tcpdump 'tcp[tcpflags] == tcp-syn' (ONLY capture packets w/ SYN flag set)
tcpdump 'tcp[tcpflags] & tcp-syn != 0' (capture packets w/ AT LEAST SYN flag set) 
tcpdump 'tcp[tcpflags] & (tcp-syn|tcp-ack) != 0' (capture packets with AT LEAST SYN OR ACK)

TASK
1. found # of packets only w/ tcp reset --> sudo tcpdump -r traffic.pcap 'tcp[tcpflags] == tcp-rst' | wc -l
2. ip address found that sent packets >15000 bytes --> sudo tcpdump -r traffic.pcap 'greater 15000' -n

DISPLAYING PACKETS
-q quick output;brief packet info
-e print link level header
-A show packet data in ASCII
-xx show packet data in hex format
-X show in -xx and -A format

TASK
1. found mac address of host that sent arp request --> sudo tcpdump -r traffic.pcap arp -e
