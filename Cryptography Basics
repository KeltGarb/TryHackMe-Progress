IMPORTANCE OF CRYPTOGRAPHY
- backgroud into purpose of the concept with CIA, SSH, remote server certificates, hash functions, etc.
- PCI DSS: security related to credit card data
- HIPPA
- HITECH
- GDPR

PLAINTEXT TO CIPHERTEXT
- basics of each term
- key encrypts plaintext to ciphertext

HISTORICAL CIPHERS
- Caesar cipher

TYPES OF ENCRYPTION
- symmetric (1 key) and some methods
- asymmetric (2 keys) and some methods

BASIC MATH
- XOR operation: think OR rules like for python
- ⊕
- can use it with cryptography like this: assigning XOR to a value with itself resulting in 0, and applying XOR to any value with 0 leaves it unchanged
- Modulo operation
- %
- remainder when x is divided by y (integers only, no floats)
TASK
- what's 1001 ⊕ 1010 --> 0011 (did this by just putting one # over the other, if same #, then 1, if different #, then 0)
- what's 118613842%9091 --> 3565: multiplied 9091 by the highest integer # possible before getting to 118613842, and found the difference
- 60%12 --> 12 fits 5x in 60, so no remainder, thus 0
