NMAP: The Basics
- NMAP: can help you identify hosts on the same or other networks, or network services on these live devices (SSH and web services)

HOST DISCOVERY: WHO IS ONLINE

scan ip range --> 192.168.0.1-10
ip subnet using / --> scan subnet --> 192.168.0.1/24 which is same as 192.168.0.0-255
can identify target by hostname --> example.thm

discover online hosts on network --> -sn
- ping scan, not limited like ping though

Read up on scanning a local network --> nmap -sn 192....../24
- can look at MAC addresses of these debices this way
- nmap starts by sending arp requests

-sL --> lists targets to scan w/o actually scanning them
-sn --> discover live hosts w/o attempting to discover services running on them

TASK
- what was the last ip address that will be scanned when your scan target is 192.168.0.1/27 --> nmap -sL 192.168.0.1/27 got me the answer

PORT SCANNING: WHO IS LISTENING
-sT tries to connect TCP 3 way handshake w/ every tcp port
-sS --> select SYN scan
-sU --> UDP services
limit targeting ports:
-F --> fast mode, scans 100 most common ports rather than default of 1k vy nmap
-p[range] allows range of ports (ex: -p10-100)
   - -p- scans all ports

TASK
1. find how many tcp ports are open at target system 10.10.25.105 --> nmap -sT 10.10.25.105

VERSION DETECTION: EXTRACT MORE INFORMATION

enable OS detection w/ -O option (usually not 100% accurate btw)
-sV --> enables verstion detection of services you found running
- can have both -O and -sV and more with -A

when running port scan, -sS for exm, target host might not reply during host discovery phase (host wont reply to icmp request)
- ask nmap to treat all hosts as online and port scan every host --> -Pn

TASK
1. find name and detected version of web server running on 10.10.25.105 --> did this by doing nmap -A 10.10.25.105 (could have done -sV)

TIMING: HOW FAST IS FAST

can control how fast a scan should go! this might help as running your scan at its normal speed might trigger IDS or other security solutions
nmap gives you 6 timing templates to control scan speed: 
0 = paranoid
1 = sneaky
2 = polite
3 = normal
4 = aggressive
5 = insane

can do parallel service probes
controlled with --min-parallelism <numprobes> and --max-parallelism <numprobes>
set min and max num of tcp/udp port probes active simultaneously for a host group. nmap by default controls # of parallel probes.
network bad, probes might go down, if good, might go up
similar: --min-rate <number> or --max-rate <number> --> rates controlled for which nmap sends packets
--host-timeout <time>  --> max time to wait for target host

OUTPUT: CONTROL WHAT YOU SEE
-v --> verbose (can do -vv, -vvv, -v2, etc.)
-d debugging-level output (up to -d9)

save scanning report:
-oN <filename> normal output
-oX <filename> xml output
-oG <filename> grep-able output (grep and awk)
-oA <basename> output in all major formats
